# Lessons Learned:
# The first difficulty is about how to separate the combined skills. There are a lot of skills appearing like SAS/R/Python, it looks like one skill, but it is actually three different skills. If we do not separate them first, the final result of the top skills required by data engineer positions will be affected. It is not very hard to separate them, simply used a function like: skills2 <- unlist(strsplit(skills1,",|, |;|; |&| & |/| or | and | and/or | or/and ")). However, in order to use that function, all letters should be in lower case or uppter case, therefore, we need to convert everything into lower case by using skills1 <- tolower(skills)
# The next difficulty came when I was doing the histogrm, with qqplot, the data can not be character variable. So I used data.frame to convert the data set into numeric variable, and in order to separate the x-axis and y-axis, I created a new row called skills and new column named count. So we can easily tell which skill has the highest amount of duplication.
